This is my personal portfolio/website that I update periodically
with stuff that I'm working on, technologies I'm using, whats on my
mind, and some past projects.

The site can be found at brandonnoll.com

A bigger project located on the site is the Atlanta Crime Map,
which can be found in the "Projects" tab. This map can be used to 
see individual crimes that happened on days from 2015-2020 and learn
a little bit more about them, while also seeing them on the interactive map.
