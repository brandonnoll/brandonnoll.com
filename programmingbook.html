                <h1>Programming Books</h1>
                <h4>December 8, 2020</h4>
                <p>
                    So, recently after realizing that I’m very unsatisfied with my programming skills and wanting to learn more
                     I decided to pick up some books to teach myself various languages and technologies. The first book I picked 
                     up around October was a Deep Learning with Python book written by Francois Chollet. I think I remember reading 
                     that he created Keras but I’m not sure, however he seems to be pretty knowledgeable in it as I read through the 
                     book. The book is helpful and will likely serve as a good basis for learning more about Machine Learning but 
                     unfortunately a lot of it goes over my head, especially preparation of the data before it’s passed into the neural 
                     network. Some of the Python shown is also challenging as I don’t have a very formal education in Python like I do in Java.

                <p>
                    After realizing my slight incompetence in Python due to the Machine Learning book, I got a Python Crash Course book and a 
                    Practical SQL book to read through just for kicks. I’ve already read through the first 100+ pages of the Python book as the 
                    basics are pretty similar to java but I’m more looking to learn the differences in syntax. It’s interesting how something 
                    comparably difficult to do in Java like sorting (sorry I’m an amateur) is so simple to do in Python. I can see why Python is 
                    touted as such a good language as it’s much more readable than Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m hoping that all this reading I’m doing over Winter break allows me to make something cool. I was thinking about using 
                    Python to scrape some data off the internet, put it into a database using SQL, and then using that data somehow with Machine 
                    Learning. Regression seems to be the most likely thing I’ll do as it’s simple and useful. I was thinking about using housing 
                    data scraped off Zillow but that’s been done a thousand times over and there’s even a regression example using housing data in 
                    the Deep Learning with Python book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wonder what the limitations of learning programming from reading books are. I’ve done a bit of searching online and everyone 
                    says you can learn a lot from reading books but most of learning / the best way to learn is by completing projects. For me at 
                    least, it’s really intimidating to jump into a project where I don’t know how to do a lot. I honestly don’t even know where to 
                    begin for starting a project that I would put on my resume or even a project for personal fulfillment. Even writing this, I’m 
                    procrastinating a bit on continuing to read through the python book. Right now. In words. I’m putting down that I’ll accomplish 
                    something coding related after finishing the Python book and the SQL book. You heard it here first folks. Stay tuned for big things in the future.
