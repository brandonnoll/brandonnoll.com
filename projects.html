                    <p>
                        Please visit the link to try out my interactive visualization of crime in Atlanta. Users can filter by the date and load crime
                        for that day onto the map. Individual points can be selected to learn a little bit more about the crime. I used PostgreSQL to clean
                        and combine data from various sources, using around 150k rows of data. The site was coded with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and the data was transferred from the PostgreSQL
                        database and hardcoded into the webpage.

                    <p>
                        AskBuzz was a project completed by me and a partner for Georgia Tech's yearly hackathon, HackGT.
                        AskBuzz is a chat bot that allows students on Georgia Tech's website to get the answers to their
                        questions about Georgia Tech without having to browse through webpage after webpage. The bot is named 
                        after our school mascot Buzz and we coded Buzz using Java.
